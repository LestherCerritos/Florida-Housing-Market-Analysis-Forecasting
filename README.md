# 🏡 Florida Housing Market Analysis & Forecasting

This project explores the relationship between **Florida's population growth**, **new housing unit construction**, and **housing prices** over time. It uses public datasets to clean, merge, visualize, and model trends — ultimately generating **forecasted housing prices** up to 2040 using linear and polynomial regression.

---

## 📊 Datasets Used

1. **FLSTHPI.csv** – Housing price index data for Florida  
2. **NewHousingUnits.csv** – Monthly new housing units constructed  
3. **statepop.xlsx** – Florida’s yearly population figures

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Analyze how housing prices in Florida are influenced by:
  - Population growth
  - Housing unit supply
- Visualize yearly trends
- Apply **linear** and **polynomial regression** to predict housing prices
- Forecast housing price trends through **2040**
